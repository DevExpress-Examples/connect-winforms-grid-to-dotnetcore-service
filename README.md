# Connect the DevExpress WinForms Data Grid to a .NET Core Service

> Please read [the blog post](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/news/archive/2024/08/21/connect-a-winforms-data-grid-to-a-net-core-service.aspx) for details about this sample.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2022 v17.0+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
* [.NET SDK 8.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)
* Download and run our [Unified Component Installer](https://www.devexpress.com/products/try/) or [add your personal DevExpress NuGet feed URL](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116042/installation/install-devexpress-controls-using-nuget-packages/obtain-your-nuget-feed-url) to Visual Studio NuGet feeds.
    
    > We recommend that you select all products when you run the DevExpress installer. Doing so will register local NuGet package sources files and item/project templates. You can uninstall unnecessary components at a later time.


## Getting Started

1.	Open *NetCoreServiceAll.sln*. [Register a DevExpress NuGet feed](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116698/nuget/setup-visual-studios-nuget-package-manager) in the Visual Studio IDE. Skip this step if you have already registered your DevExpress NuGet feed.
2.	Restore NuGet packages in the solution:

3.	Run the **DataService** project. Right-click DataService in the Solution Explorer and select **Debug** | **Start New Instance** in the menu. Your default web browser will open. 
    
    > **IMPORTANT**
    > 
    > Do not close the web browser.
4.  To initialize sample data when you run the service for the first time, navigate to `http://localhost:5146/api/populateTestData` in the open web browser. You will see the following message: *"Data populated successfully"*.
5.  Run the **WinForms.Client** project. Right-click WinForms.Client in the Solution Explorer and select **Debug** | **Start New Instance** in the menu.
6.  You can scroll to the end of the data list in the grid and observe more data being loaded. You can sort by clicking column headers. The *Output* tool window within Visual Studio will display information about load status from both running processes. The animation below displays results:

## Implementation Details

### The Backend: an ASP.NET Core WebAPI service using Entity Framework Core

The backend project is called *DataService* and it was created using the standard ASP.NET Core WebAPI template. There are two endpoint handlers in the service, one to generate some test data and the other to query data.

The second handler, at the URL /data/OrderItems, accepts several optional parameters (to support `skip`, `take`, and `sort` features). The code queries data from the Entity Framework Core database context and uses standard `IQueryable<T>` based helpers to implement data shaping functionality. The `TotalCount` field is returned together with data and is used on the client side to determine the total amount of data available for the request.

```csharp
app.MapGet("/data/OrderItems", async (
  DataServiceDbContext dbContext,
  int skip = 0, int take = 20,
  string sortField = "Id", bool sortAscending = true) =>
{
  var source =
    dbContext.OrderItems.AsQueryable()
      .OrderBy(sortField + (sortAscending ? " ascending" : " descending"));
  var items = await source.Skip(skip).Take(take).ToListAsync();

  var totalCount = await dbContext.OrderItems.CountAsync();

  return Results.Ok(new
  {
    Items = items,
    TotalCount = totalCount
  });
});
```

### The Frontend: a Windows Forms app with a DevExpress Data Grid

In the `MainForm` of the Windows Forms application, the DevExpress GridControl control is bound to a `VirtualServerModeSource` instance (a collection of `OrderItem` objects). To fetch data, the VirtualServerModeSource handles the following events:

* `ConfigurationChanged` - Fires when the grid changes relevant parts of its runtime configuration in response to user interaction (for example, when the user clicks a column header to apply sort operations).
* `MoreRows` - Fires when an initial fetch operation returns a result, which indicates that more data is available. In this instance, the grid attempts to retrieve additional data rows if and when the user scrolls to the bottom of the currently loaded data set.

In this example, the data loaded from the backend is encoded as JSON. `DataFetchResult` models the structure of the response provided by the backend endpoint, including the `TotalCount` property:

```csharp
public class DataFetchResult {
  public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; } = null!;
  public int TotalCount { get; set; }
}
```

The `GetRowsAsync` method handles retrieved data. The method is invoked during the initial load (from the `ConfigurationChanged` handler) and subsequent loads (from the `MoreRows` handler). Data is fetched using `HttpClient`, with skip, take, and sorting properties passed as URL parameters. The results are deserialized from JSON and returned along with the `moreRowsAvailable` flag:

```csharp
public Task<VirtualServerModeRowsTaskResult>
  GetRowsAsync(VirtualServerModeRowsEventArgs e)
{
  return Task.Run(async () =>
    {
      using var client = new HttpClient();
      var response = await client.GetAsync(
        $"{System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["baseUrl"]}/data/OrderItems?skip={e.CurrentRowCount}&take={BatchSize}&sortField={SortField}&sortAscending={SortAscending}");
      response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
      var responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

      var dataFetchResult =
        JsonSerializer.Deserialize<DataFetchResult>(
          responseBody, new JsonSerializerOptions
          {
            PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true
          });

      if (dataFetchResult is null)
        return new VirtualServerModeRowsTaskResult();

      var moreRowsAvailable =
        e.CurrentRowCount + dataFetchResult.Items.Count < dataFetchResult.TotalCount;

    return new VirtualServerModeRowsTaskResult(
      dataFetchResult.Items, moreRowsAvailable);
  }, e.CancellationToken);
}
```
